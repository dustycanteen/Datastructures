# Datastructures Library

The Datastructures library is a C++ library designed for to test an alternative means of data structure management. Unlike traditional data structure libraries that encapsulate both behavior and state, Datastructures takes a unique approach by providing interface-driven structures. This design leaves state management entirely in the hands of the user, aiming to see whether this can offer greater control and adaptability in algorithmic composition and implementation.

## Features

- **State-Agnostic Design**: By decoupling state management from the data structures, the library promotes a separation of concerns that enhances modularity and flexibility. Users are free to manage state as best suits their application, allowing for cleaner, more understandable code.

## Getting Started

Integrating the Datastructures library into your project is straightforward. Clone the repository, include the desired headers in your C++ project. Optionally you can use the included build.sh shell script to build the test project in driver.cpp
